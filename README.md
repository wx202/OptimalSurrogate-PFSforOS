Wang, X., Cai, T., Tian, L. and Parast, L., 2024. Model-free Approach to Evaluate a Censored Intermediate Outcome as a Surrogate for Overall Survival. arXiv preprint arXiv:2412.14129.

Specifically, we propose a nonparametric approach to evaluate a censored surrogate outcome, such as time to progression (progression free survival, PFS), when the primary outcome is also a censored time-to-event outcome (overall survival, OS), such as time to death, and the treatment effect of interest is the difference in overall survival. Specifically, we define the proportion of the treatment effect on the primary outcome that is explained (PTE) by the censored surrogate outcome in this context, and estimate this proportion by defining and deriving an optimal transformation of the surrogate information.
